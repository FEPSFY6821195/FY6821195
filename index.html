          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            Biomimicry (derived from Biomimetics) is a vast field of science that takes inspiration from natural designs that have evolved for billions of years before the advent of modern technology. With a focus on improving ecological impact, biomimicry can greatly improve the efficiency of our designs. Despite human flight having a plethora of wild equivalents to take inspiration from and an emerging issue of sustainability, it is noteworthy that planes do not look like birds. It comes down to differences in the power, scale and purpose of human and bird flight. Manned planes are much bigger and heavier than any bird and do not need to be as multifunctional. While human flight is, in some respects, fundamentally different to bird flight, we can still learn a lot from the 160 million years in which birds mastered flying.

          <h2>A brief, disorganised history</h2>
          <p>
            In the 1950’s the Scientist, Otto Schmitt, attempted to create a physical device which mimicked the electrical action of a nerve <a href="#ref10">(Julian et al., 2006)</a>. He would go on to coin Biomimetics to describe an emerging field of science inspired by natural designs. Biomimetics “refers to the technical translation and realization of functional strategies used by biological organisms or systems in Nature” <a href="#ref8">(DeLuca, 2014)</a>. Despite its ratification in the 60’s, examples of biomimetics can be traced back to ancient civilizations <a href="#ref15">(Schreiner, 2018)</a>; It’s believed the pyramids shape was inspired by the structure of mountain peaks, the first umbrellas in China were designed to resemble lotus leaves and their flexible properties <a href="#ref15">(Schreiner, 2018)</a>.
          </p>
          <p>  
            Although closely related to Biomimetics, it was not until 1997 that biomimicry was popularised by Janine Benyus. Biomimicry emphasises natural designs with an aim to improve sustainability by taking “Nature as a measure”, appreciating the billions of years of earth’s evolution seeking answers to problems nature has already solved and improved <a href="#ref5">(Benyus, 2002, preface)</a>.

                With pre-covid levels of air traffic in 2019, “aviation was responsible for 2.6% of world CO2 emissions” <a href="#ref12.5">(Planès et al., 2021)</a>. This total is predicted to continue rising if there is insufficient change in the industry, as demonstrated in figure 1 <a href="#ref12.5">(Planès et al., 2021)</a>.</p>
              <p>
                Could biomimicry play a key role in reversing this trend? Or, more generally, “should airplanes look like birds?” This question that was brought to discussion at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in 2010 <a href="#ref4">(American Physical Society, 2010)</a>. Geoffrey Spedding, an engineer at the University of Southern California commented on a proposed, biomimetic design: "At the very least, we can show that there exists an alternative design that is aerodynamically superior … there is now an imperative to further explore this (and perhaps other) designs that could make a significant difference to our global energy consumption patterns." <a href="#ref3">(American Institute of Physics, 2010)</a>

            Birds, through an estimated 160 million years <a href="#ref11">(Malsbury, 2020)</a> of natural selection, are significantly better at flying than modern aircraft; They can take off and land anywhere without the use of a runway, perform complex manoeuvres in a fraction of the time it takes a fighter jet and do it all with a natural, fuel free diet. To understand why planes are so dissimilar to birds we must look at the differences in how each tackles the challenge of flight and why this is relevant to their respective evolutionary needs.

                Generating lift to overcome gravity and remain airborne is the first and most important aspect of flight. Once a bird or plane is at its intended altitude and speed, both will largely rely on the gliding properties of their wings to remain in the air <a href="#ref19">(Williams, 2009, p124-125)</a>. How each generates the power to get to this position, however, is the greatest fundamental difference between the two <a href="#ref19">(Williams, 2009, p43)</a>. Birds are powered by muscles, to push themselves of the ground and flap their wings, generating lift. Aircraft are powered by engines, which propel a plane with fixed wings forward; It’s the shape of the wing that, when moving through air at high speeds, creates a difference of pressure above and below the wing, generating lift <a href="#ref12">(NASA, no date)</a>. It has been shown that flapping wings have positive effects on the stability, flexibility and manoeuvrability of a bird <a href="#ref18">(Warrick et al., 2002)</a>, potential unapplicable to fixed-wing aircraft. 
              </p>
              <p>
                However, at a bird-sized scale the propellors of a jet engine would be inefficient and use too much energy to improve upon flapping <a href="#ref19">(Williams, 2009, p233)</a> <a href="#ref9">(Gold, 2009)</a>. Recent research from Beihang University, China supports this. A flapping mechanism was produced for use on a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with wings modelled after those of a bat <a href="#ref6">(Bie et al., 2021)</a>. The prototype, in figure 2, claims to support a considerable payload with enhanced manoeuvrability over traditional fixed-wing UAV’s <a href="#ref6">(Bie et al., 2021)</a>.

              <p>
                Issues arise when scaling flapping to bigger aircraft. Although longer wings are more efficient by reducing drag <a href="#ref14">(Sampson, 2023)</a>, there is increased weight. Creating artificial muscles to flap wings of this size is impractical. We can learn this biomimetically by observing the trend of natural selection favouring decreasing sizes of birds in the pre-evolution of bird flight, shown in figure 3 <a href="#ref16">(Singer, 2015)</a>. For small, unmanned aircraft, flapping could be the future; However, with no birds close to the size of even the smallest planes it’s understandable that the industry has dismissed it as a suitable alternative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Birds are often specialised to their respective habitats, yet they all still face a range of challenges unapplicable to aircraft: hunting for food, evading predators and tending to family; These functions rely on improved adaptability and manoeuvrability that comes with flapping.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is not to say we cannot learn from birds. It is often overlooked that many of the forefathers of flight studied birds extensively to understand the concepts of flight when humans couldn’t <a href="#ref2">(Allameh & Leniham, 2022)</a>. We may also realise, looking at the comparisons in figures below, biomimetic design is often obscured by differences in materials.

          <h2 class="w">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Why do planes not look like birds? It comes down to differences in purpose, scale and the power source required to fulfil them. Biomimicry is not about producing aircraft identical to birds; It’s about improving what we already have by tapping into the evolution of natural equivalents. The size and weight of manned aircraft already exceeds the largest birds, as such we require a power source beyond nature’s scope. While flapping is only likely to be adopted in UAV applications, all aircraft can still learn from birds. Through biomimetic progression we can look to nature to improve the impact of human flight. Compared to birds, human flight is still in its infancy, and we still have much to learn.
